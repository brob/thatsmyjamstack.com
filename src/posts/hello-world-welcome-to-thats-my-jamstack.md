Hello World! My name is Bryan Robinson and I love the JAMstack!

I’ve always enjoyed working on static sites. They’re quick for users. They’re quick to build. And, as it turns out, they’re not that static anymore.

I’m on a quest to find more JAMstackers and get their stories.

That’s why I’ve created That’s My JAMstack!

This podcast is all about the passions of the JAMstack community.

I’ll be seeking out amazing developers and designers of all walks of life to talk to me about what they do with the JAMstack and why they love this movement on the web.

Come join me on this journey. Find out about new and amazing services and techniques. Meet some wonderful folks.

Most importantly, join this community of makers on the web!
